# FG_RNN
**F**igure-**G**round Organization with a Biologically Plausible **R**ecurrent **N**eural **N**etwork

Based on approach of [Hu et. al. 2019](https://github.com/brianhhu/FG_RNN).

## Demo
To run the model:
run **test_feedback.m** to test. At the top you can select the preferred stimulus.

## Paper
For more details about the model and/or experiments, please see the paper:
